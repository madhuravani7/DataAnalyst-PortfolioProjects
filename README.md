Let me give you a quick overview about this Repo. 
It's where I upload my data analytical projects. I have so far used the below tools and languages for cleaning data, visualizations, accessing data.
# SQL 
Covid Data Portfolio project #1. worked with around 400k rows, visalized the data using the SQL SELECT, CTE, Temp tables, Views. Made use of Partition by, group by, order by and aggregate functions like SUM, AVG etc.
# SQL for Data Cleaning
I used the Nashville data set to clean by first removing the duplicates. Created new columns where necessary, made the data readable
# Excel
Here, I worked on Bike Buyers and used Pivot tables, conditional formatting, dashboards to visually display the data
# Tableau
And then I created dashboards in tableau for airbnb data where you can see how each type of property is performing in different areas and price ranges accordingly
# PowerBI
I really loved working with Power BI. I can say its quite similar to Excel but more advanced version which makes it easier to perform different functions. I used profession survey data to see how likely different professions earn in different countries, how happy they are with work/life balance, most programmers favorite language and more.
# Python
I created a automated file sorter for file manager to sort all the files into their respective type folders. Quite useful
# Pandas
I used pandas for data cleaning, reading the files and displaying the data visually using beautiful soup, numpy etc.
